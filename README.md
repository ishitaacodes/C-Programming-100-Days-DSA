# 100 Days of Code: DSA in C Programming

Welcome to 100 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C Programming! I'm Ishita (ishitaacodes), and I'm excited to share with you this curated collection of C programs focusing on fundamental data structures and algorithms.

## About This Repository
In this repository, you'll find 100 days' worth of C code examples covering various data structures and algorithms commonly encountered in computer science and programming interviews. Each day's code is designed to be concise, clear, and helpful for learning and understanding key concepts.

## How to Use
Feel free to explore this repository day by day. Each day's code is organized into its own directory (`Day1`, `Day2`, ..., `Day100`) and contains a C file (`main.c`) with the implementation along with a `README.md` explaining the concept and usage.

You can use this repository in several ways:
- **Learning:** Follow along day by day to gradually build your understanding of DSA in C.
- **Practice:** Implement the code snippets on your own to reinforce your learning.
- **Reference:** Use this repository as a reference guide for revisiting concepts.

## Topics Covered
Here's a glimpse of the topics covered throughout the 100 days:
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
- Graphs and Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Dynamic Programming
- And more!
